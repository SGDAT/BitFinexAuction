Hi bitfinex.

I was not able to complete the task within the time given. However, you will find that the current implementation has a peer-to-peer like function. The first instance behaves as a server if it cannot connect to any servers and every other instance created connects to the first instance.

I have only been able to implement the server functions but I did not have time to call them from the console menu aswell as test their workings. I hope this is going in the right direction.

Kind regards,

Samson
