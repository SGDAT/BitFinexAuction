Hi bitfinex.

This task took me a few hours extra to complete. However, you will find that the peer-to-peer like function aswell as the auction functionality. The first instance behaves as a server if it cannot connect to any servers and every other instance created connects to the first instance.

This is now complete.

Kind regards,

Samson
