Hi bitfinex.

I was not able to complete the task within the time given. However, you will find that the current implementation has a peer-to-peer like function. The first instance behaves as a server if it cannot connect to any servers and every other instance created connects to the first instance.

This is now complete.

Kind regards,

Samson
